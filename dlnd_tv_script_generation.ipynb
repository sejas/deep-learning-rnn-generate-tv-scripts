    "Implement an RNN using PyTorch's [Module class](http://pytorch.org/docs/master/nn.html#torch.nn.Module). You may choose to use a GRU or an LSTM. To complete the RNN, you'll have to implement the following functions for the class:\n",
    " - `__init__` - The initialize function. \n",
    " - `init_hidden` - The initialization function for an LSTM/GRU hidden state\n",
    " - `forward` - Forward propagation function.\n",

    "\n",
    "1. Make sure to stack the outputs of the lstm to pass to your fully-connected layer, you can do this with `lstm_output = lstm_output.contiguous().view(-1, self.hidden_dim)`\n",
